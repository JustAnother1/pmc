Pacemaker Client
----------------

The pacemaker client is the counterpart to the pacemaker host. The Client handles the time critical tasks.
You can find the pacemaker host here: https://github.com/JustAnother1/Pacemaker

Summary
-------

The Pacemaker protocol provides an open interface to allow the separation of real-time and non-real-time control components for 3D printers, CNC machines and laser cutters.

This has the huge benefit of allowing new controller hardware (the real-time component) to work with existing host software solutions (the non-real-time component). This makes it easy to expand the Pacemaker system to new machines.

Pacemaker allows a much richer level of machine control by the non-real-time host software than is possible with typical G-code based systems. This provides feature-rich host software, more integrated start-to-finish tool chain solutions whilst still being able to operate on a wide range of platforms.

Building and Starting
---------------------

The firmware can be build using make. The generated Files will be placed in the bin folder. For details try
